## Key Concepts I Learned Today

- **Advanced ggplot**

### Advanced ggplot
ggplot is based on the "Grammar of Graphics" by Leland Wilkinson. In essence, each ggplot is built up from the following layers: 

- Data
- Aesthetics
- Geometries
- Facets
- Statistics
- Coordinates
- Theme

The essential code that an author has to provide for a ggplot is very simple and looks as follows. The tool provides defaults (which of course can be changed) for the other layers:

```R
ggplot(data) +
geom_function()
```

The aesthetics can then be defined for every geometric object individually or globally for the plot itself.

In a free coding exercise, we tried to re-create plots from popular publishers. This task showcased the immense versatility of ggplot2 and its extensions (material taken from the RaukR summer school 2023. Author: Roy Francis).

## Reflections
Although I am a frequent user of ggplot2 and its functionalities, the theory behind the tools was interesting to hear and helped me better understand why I am doing the things that I am doing. Re-creating the published figures was an especially fun task!
