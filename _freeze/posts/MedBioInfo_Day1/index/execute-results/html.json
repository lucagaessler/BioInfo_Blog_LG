The goal was to create an ordered list of all participant's names. An easy task at first but not if you consider the following rule: \"Each student can only write their own name in a stand-alone file.\". This means that the course members had to collaborate on GitHub to merge their documents and handle potential conflicts. The idea was to work in pairs, then collaborate with the merged list of another pair, and so on... The final workflow was less structured but we still managed to come up with the full list in the end.\n\nThe merge workflow always looked as follows:\n\n```{bash}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: fenced\ngit pull # update local repository\ngit checkout [branch_1] # switch to branch that will be merged into\ngit merge [branch_2] # merge the two branches\n# solve conflicts\ngit add # stage changes\ngit commit # commit changes\ngit push # add changes to remote repo\n```\n\n### Additional thoughts: setting up an SSH agent\n\n## Quarto Blogs\n\n\n\n## GitHub Actions\n\n# Reflections\n\nWrite your thoughts and reflections about the material covered.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nWhat do you plan to explore or learn next?\n\n",
